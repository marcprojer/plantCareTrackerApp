## Plant Cate Tracker App

Plant Care Tracker App
This project will help you keep track of each plant’s care schedule (watering, sunlight needs) and log basic notes about their health or growth progress.

# Key Features

Plant name and type.

A form to update the plant’s last watering date.
Care Reminders

Based on the watering frequency you set, the app will show if a plant is due for watering.
Display the watering reminder visually (e.g., with a red icon if overdue).
